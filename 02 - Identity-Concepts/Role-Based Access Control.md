# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an authorization model that grants permissions based on organizational roles rather than directly assigning permissions to individual users.

Instead of managing permissions for every user separately, organizations assign permissions to roles, and users inherit those permissions through their assigned roles. This simplifies access management and improves security.

## How RBAC Works

RBAC follows a simple hierarchy:

```
Permissions
      ↓
    Roles
      ↓
    Users
```

For example:

```
User: Alice
      ↓
Role: Help Desk Administrator
      ↓
Permissions:
    - Reset Passwords
    - Unlock Accounts
    - View Users
```

## Why Use RBAC?

Managing permissions individually becomes difficult as organizations grow.

RBAC helps organizations:

- Simplify permission management.
- Reduce administrative overhead.
- Improve security consistency.
- Support auditing and compliance requirements.
- Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege.

## Principle of Least Privilege

RBAC works closely with the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).

Users should receive only the permissions necessary to perform their job responsibilities and nothing more.

### Example

```
Sales Employee
    ✓ View Customers
    ✓ Create Orders
    ✗ Manage Users

Sales Manager
    ✓ View Customers
    ✓ Create Orders
    ✓ Approve Discounts

Administrator
    ✓ Full Access
```

## Built-in and Custom Roles

Many platforms provide predefined roles for common administrative tasks.

Examples include:

- Global Administrator
- User Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Billing Administrator

Organizations may also create custom roles when specific permission sets are required.

## Benefits of RBAC

- Simplified administration
- Scalable permission management
- Stronger security controls
- Better compliance and auditing
- Support for least-privilege access
- Reduced risk of privilege escalation

## Key Takeaways

- RBAC is an authorization model.
- Permissions are assigned to roles, not directly to users.
- Users inherit permissions through role assignments.
- RBAC supports the Principle of Least Privilege.
- RBAC is a core component of modern identity and access management solutions.
